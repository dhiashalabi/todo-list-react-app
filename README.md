# React todo list app

Hey, hey 👋

This is the _example code_ for the React todo app, which I build in the “Learn React for Free” Scrimba course.

## Running the example code

Run these commands, one after the other:

```
git clone https://github.com/scrimba/react-todo-app-tutorial 
npm install
npm run build
open index.html
```
